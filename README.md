## Teacher Recommendation Guidelines 

Where’s the best place to start? Briefly identify yourself and your relationship to the student (for how long and in what capacity do you know him/her?). Identify the class(es) taught and the level of rigor.

What should be addressed? Use any superlative you honestly can. Not every student can be the best, but there are countless categories – most memorable, satisfying to teach, insightful, engaged, or energetic. Tell the college what stands out about the applicant. Use details and give concrete examples to back up your view.

Remember, your letter will provide the opportunity for a college to see what growth that student may have exhibited, insights he/she may have contributed to your class, talents which may not be obvious, and personal characteristics or qualities that may be particularly outstanding. If you have a story to tell about a student, tell it. A good anecdote is far more effective than even the most carefully chosen list of adjectives. 

Tell things that are not provided anywhere else in the application, particularly things that could not be gleaned from the transcript or the list of activities.

Are there ways to address your student’s personal characteristics – curiosity, open- mindedness, leadership, integrity, compassion, maturity and independence – using specific examples?

Can you convey some sense of the quality of the student’s mind – imagination, intellectual zeal, penetrating analysis, contributions to the intellectual climate, perceptive understanding, self-awareness, diverse interests or perspectives – with details that go beyond a list of adjectives?

Have you addressed the how and why of what you are saying in your recommendation? Can you place this student within the context of other students you have taught? Are your comments precise and substantive? Have you provided evidence of your claims?

## What if it’s not all good news?
Don’t be afraid of making some critical comments. Only glowing remarks, especially for average students, may make the reader skeptical and weaken credibility. It is okay to address weaknesses, especially if the student has grown. Strengths, then, will be more distinguishable and believable.

If a student has a rising or declining record over the course of the year, offer an explanation that might be helpful in understanding the change. Include specific examples of motivation, commitment, hard work, improvement, growth, and potential for success.

Trust that the reader can read between the lines of effusive as well as more muted writing. Every letter of recommendation cannot and should not be over the top; but it should be honest.

## Other Notes
Be sure that your letter provides substantive information that will not be found elsewhere in the application. It should focus on the student’s academic performance in your class. Information regarding extracurricular activities will be covered through other components of the application, including the counselor recommendation. Limit comments about extracurricular activities only to those with which you have personal experience (for example, serving as the student’s coach or as a chaperone on a service trip).

Keep letters confidential – do not share with students and/or parents.

Don’t agree to write on a student’s behalf unless you feel confident you can write a supportive letter.

Don’t disclose a learning difference or personal circumstances unless a student gives you permission to do so.

Keep in mind that many of our students apply to the same colleges and their applications will typically be read by the same person (often together).
